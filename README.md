# 🏦 Bank Account Management System (Python)

A **Python-based command-line Bank Account Management System** that allows users to create bank accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and view account balances. The system uses a CSV file as a persistent data store and leverages **Pandas** for efficient data handling.

This project is well-suited for beginners learning **Python, file handling, Pandas, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

## 📊 Dataset Requirements

The CSV file (`python_bankAccount.csv`) must contain the following columns:

- `cust_id`
- `first_name`
- `last_name`
- `ph_num`
- `balance`

Example:

```
cust_id,first_name,last_name,ph_num,balance
1,John,Doe,1234567890,500
```

## 🧠 How It Works

- User data is loaded from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame
- Each operation (create, deposit, withdraw, balance check) updates the DataFrame
- All changes are saved back to the CSV file when the program exits

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Input validation and exception handling
- PIN/password authentication
- Transaction history tracking
- Interest calculation
- GUI or web-based interface
- Database integration (SQLite/MySQL)

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

- Practical use of Pandas for CRUD operations
- Understanding data persistence with CSV files
- Building menu-driven CLI applications
- Applying OOP principles in Python
